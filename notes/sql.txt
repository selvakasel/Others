1. SQL Query Types

     (a)SELECT Statement :
            The SQL SELECT statement is used to retrieve records from one or more 
   tables in your SQL database.



SQL ALIASES      : Temporary names for columns or tables

and OR condition :The SQL AND condition and OR condition can be combined to test for multiple conditions in 
                  a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
               WHERE condition1
               AND condition2
               ...
               OR condition_n;

SQL BETWEEN condition : The SQL BETWEEN condition allows you to easily test if an expression is within a range of values
                        Syntax : expression BETWEEN value1 AND value2;


Comparison Operators :


      Comparison Operator	Description
              =	                  Equal
              <>	          Not Equal
              !=	          Not Equal
              >	                  Greater Than
              >=	          Greater Than or Equal
              <	                  Less Than
              <=	          Less Than or Equal
              IN ( )	          Matches a value in a list
              NOT	          Negates a condition
              BETWEEN	          Within a range (inclusive)
              IS NULL	          NULL value
              IS NOT NULL	  Non-NULL value
              LIKE	          Pattern matching with % and _
              EXISTS	          Condition is met if subquery returns at least one row
